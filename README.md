## Overview

Voice StockBot is an AI-powered voice chatbot that leverages 8090's xRx framework, Whisper and Llama3 70b on Groq, TTS on Elevenlabs, Polygon.io's stock API, and TradingView’s live widgets to respond in conversation with the user with live, interactive charts and interfaces specifically tailored to your requests. Groq's speed makes tool calling and providing a response near instantaneous, allowing for a sequence of two API calls with separate specialized prompts to return a response.
